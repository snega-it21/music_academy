<h2 style="color:blue";>ABOUT MUSIC</h2>
<p>Music is the art of arranging sounds in time through the elements of melody, harmony, rhythm, and timbre.
It is one of the universal cultural aspects of all human societies.
General definitions of music include common elements such as pitch, rhythm, dynamics, and the sonic qualities of timbre and texture.
Different styles or types of music may emphasize, de-emphasize or omit some of these elements.
Music is performed with a vast range of instruments and vocal techniques ranging from singing to rapping;
there are solely instrumental pieces, solely vocal pieces and pieces that combine singing and instruments.

<h1 style="color:blue";><center>TYPES OF MUSICS</center></h1>
<h2 style="color:blue";><center>classes</center></h2>
<h2 style="color:blue";>CLASSIC MUSIC CLASS</h2>
<p>Classical music generally refers to the formal musical tradition of the Western world, considered to be distinct from Western folk music or popular music traditions.
It is sometimes distinguished as Western classical music, as the term "classical music" may also refer to non-Western traditions which exhibit similar formal qualities.
In addition to formality, classical music is often characterized by complexity in its musical form and harmonic organization,[1] particularly with the use of polyphony.
The earliest extant music manuscripts date from the Carolingian Empire (800–888),[3] around the time which Western plainchant gradually unified into what is termed Gregorian chant.</p>

<h2 style="color:blue";>CARNATIC MUSIC</h2>
<p>Carnatic music, known as Karnāṭaka saṃgīta or Karnāṭaka saṅgītam in the South Indian languages, is a system of music commonly associated with South India.
It is one of two main subgenres of Indian classical music that evolved from ancient Sanatana dharma sciences and traditions, particularly the Samaveda.
The other subgenre being Hindustani music, which emerged as a distinct form because of Persian or Islamic influences from Northern India.
The main emphasis in Carnatic music is on vocal music; most compositions are written to be sung, and even when played on instruments, they are meant to be performed in gāyaki style</p>

<h2 style="color:blue";>HIP POP</h2>
<p>Hip hop music or hip-hop music, also known as rap music,is a genre of popular music developed in the United States by inner-city African Americans,
Latino  Americans and Jamaicans in the Bronx borough of New York City in the 1970s.
It consists of a stylized rhythmic music that commonly accompanies rapping, a rhythmic and rhyming speech that is chanted.
While often used to refer solely to rapping, "hip hop" more properly denotes the practice of the entire subculture.
Hip hop as both a musical genre and a culture was formed during the 1970s when block parties became increasingly popular in New York City,
particularly among African American youth residing in the Bronx .</p>
